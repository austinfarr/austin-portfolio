      "In a transformative project for Arise Africa, I developed a custom-built Real-time Digital Auction application using Next.js and Supabase. My focus was to engineer a robust platform that handled real-time bidding with advanced categorization and an optimized search function, replacing their previous third-party service constraints. \n The technical infrastructure provided a server-side rendered frontend for better performance and SEO, while Supabase's real-time database facilitated a lively and responsive bidding experience. The result was a cost-effective, reusable platform that greatly improved user engagement and operational efficiency. \nLaunching successfully at the \"Arise Together\" event, the application supported a user base of over 200, raising significant funds and laying the groundwork for sustainable future events. This project not only advanced Arise Africa's fundraising capabilities but also reinforced my portfolio with a showcase of scalable, client-focused web application development.",
